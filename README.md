# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code and report for the for work done on top of codebase from the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics] course [Machine Learning Practical].

This assignment-based course is focused on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students who do this course will have experience in the design, implementation, training, and evaluation of machine learning systems.

Activation functions help Artificial Neural Networks to learn and make sense of the non-linearity between the inputs and outputs. Deep neural networks are difficult to train and making a better learning model is to play around with different hyper parameters, tweaking them and bringing a right fit among them.
This report deals with some of the most commonly used hyper parameters, and the selection process based on the learning model you want to build based on the understanding and adjustments of the hyper parameters. It discusses the layers of depth needed to train the model well and making it robust.

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the course that students will implement parts of and extend during the course labs and assignments,
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing explanatory material and coding exercises to be completed during the course labs.
